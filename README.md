# Personal Website of Victor Arsenescu - Lab 4 COMP120

### Comments

- I have correctly implemented a `resume.html` file with my *real* resume on it.
My full name is listed on the initial `index.html` homepage, so I omitted it here
for stylistic reasons. Obviously everything is listed in full in the PDF, but if
you read through the **Highlights** section of the page, you will see that it describes
where I went to school, my current position, relevant coursework, professional experience, skills, and related activities. They're just not explicitly marked with those headers because I didn't like the way it looked.

- I have correctly implemented a (real) short biography of myself in the `bio.html` file.

- I have correctly implemented a personal homepage in the `index.html` file, which
has my name, **and allows visitors to choose the language they'd like to proceed in**. Before you say it, no, I did not use Javascript for the translation or the super fancy dropdown menus - it's pure CSS baby (and I'm fluent in those three, so I literally sat there and wrote everything three times lmao). It links to all three pairs of resume and biography pages, and it is accessible at http://v0rtex20k.github.io

#### Furthermore, I have verified the following:

- [x] All my HTML pages **DO** pass the official HTML5 specifications via https://validator.w3.org/.
- [x] I used 3 CSS files with wayyyyy more than 5 rules.
- [x] All my CSS files **DO** pass the official CSS validation via https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. *However, I would like to note that I do get some
warnings raised for the way I imported fonts from google fonts and the way I defined some custom colors `--tufts-blue` and `--tufts-brown` as well as the variable I created to govern the size of bullet points in lists, `--marker-size`*.
- [x] I did not use frames at all, but ironically I did make my own class *called* frame.
- [x] I did not use styling elements.
- [x] All styling was defined in CSS.
- [x] I did not use any styling attribute in elements.
- [x] I only used relative URLs for images.
- [x] I did not use front-end frameworks.
- [x] All CSS files are strictly my own.
- [x] I did not use JavaScript or jQuery at all (although I was tempted to).
- [x] All files names were lowercase and with standard characters.
- [x] Everything is stored in this repo.

### I did not discuss this with anyone, and worked completely independently.

All in all, this took me around 12 hours, on and off over 3 days. But that was kind of my own fault for doing it in three languages, to be fair.
